# Battleships: An Intermediate JavaScript Project

## About

This is the [final project from the JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship) hosted by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The aim of this project is to build a working implementation of the board game [Battleships](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)>) whilst following the principles of [Test-Driven Development(TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).

For this project, [JEST](https://jestjs.io/) is being used to test the JavaScript code. Additionally, [unit tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) are the focus of testing throughout this project. All other testing, such as integration tests, are outside the scope of this course.
